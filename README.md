# Knight-Movement

the number_of_steps_slow.py program keeps finding all the next moves for a knight one step at a time untill the end-point is found.

the number_of_steps_medium.py program goes through different if-else statements which gives specific instructions on the steps you need to take get to the end-point (number of steps and path you need to take).

the number_of_steps_fast.py calculates the number of steps it would take a knight to get to the destination in O(1) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
