# Knight-Movement

the knightmovement.py program keeps finding all the moves for a knight one step at a time untill the end-point is found.

the shortest_path_for_a_knight.py program goes through different if-statements which gives the steps you need to take get to the end-point (number of steps and path you need to take).

the no_of_steps.py program also goes through different if-statements to find the minimum number of steps needed to get to a point (only number of steps).
